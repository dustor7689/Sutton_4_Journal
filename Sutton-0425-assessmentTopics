The 10 subjcts I believe will be covered on the test are the similarities and differences between arduino and java because of it's recentness in relation to the test,
Java libraries because of their importance to the functionality of the code, code and online ethics because it's important to be a good person apparently,
forloops, datatypes, classes, publ
ic and private, if statements, booleans, and int's because they are essiantial to the use of java.
