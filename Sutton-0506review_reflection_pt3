Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate? Why? How does this happen?
[67] is the x coordinate and [43] is the y coordinate. Because "mymap[][]" by default arranges it so that it recongnises the first box as x coordinates and the second as y coordinates.

    Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
	if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); this code will print out 8888 if i=0.
    Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
	System.out.print(map[i][j]); this code will print out the map.
    Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
	System.out.print(".");
    Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
	System.out.println(map[i][j]); this code will print out the map.
    Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
    Explain the use of static.
	Static is used to give a value that wil remain unchanged for the rest of the code.
    Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
