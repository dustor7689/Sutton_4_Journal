I am the student that lacked recollection of 2-D arrays. 
This is mostly due to my lack of finesse in coding 
and my lack of quality memory resulting in lackluster coding that is 
my game currently. 
1. conversion of player to object 2. multiple levels of arrays
3. classes with subclasses 4. blocking terain 
5. the effects of input in relation to the arrays
6. enemy configuration 7. trap configuraton 8. tracking arrays
9. class constructors 10. object initialization
