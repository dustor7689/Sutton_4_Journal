If I had just been willing to spend more time after school on my game I would not be in this position right now (incomplete game). I was unwilling to stay after school for the sake of my game forsaking it due to my blatant lazyness.

My problem solving steps include reading the error messsage(s), interacting with the tooltips/netbeans suggestions and fiddling with my code to see if it fixes the error(s), asking my peers for assistance with the problem(s), and then pestering ms davis for assistance.
