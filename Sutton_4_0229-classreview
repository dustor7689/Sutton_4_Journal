1. How do we make a class? What code comes at the beginning?
We make a class by typing in public class Blank{   } or just class Blank{    }. The code that comes before this are all import(s) and package.

2. Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
is this a class constructor?
No, this creates an object not a class-but it calls on the class constructor calling it class "Donut", with Donut();.

3. How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?
public class Cake{
	string icing;
	boolean isEaten;
	int layers;
	boolean hasCandles;
	int candles;

	public Cake(String a, int b){
		This.icing = a;
		This.isEaten = false;
		This.layers = b;		
	}
//a getter gets, i.e., a getter will return a value from a object, e.g., 
	public boolean getisEaten();{
	return this.isEaten;
}
//a setter set the variable vlue for the instance,
public void setisEaten(boolean b){
this.isEaten = b;
} 
}
4. Explain in your own words - what is a getter? what does it do?
Cake Josh = new Cake("yellow",3);
Josh.setisEaten();
5. What is a setter? what does it do? Give an example.
Josh.setisEaten(true);
