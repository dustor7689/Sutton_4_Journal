Between C programming and arduino I have noticed that arduino appears to be more simple, less bulky, while the forloops appear to be the same. 
Arduino can complete tasks such as flickering the light(s) with a mere 2-4 lines of code in total with code that easily stands for the purpose it serves. 
Arudino is similar in that they both have similar forms with forloops.

Me and my parnter have adapted the code by changing the delays with the LED lights changing how fast the lights flicker.

A circuit requires a path for electricity to flow completely through it in a circle.

In Arduino programs are compiled via Arduino IDE by the typing of code, then the compile, thusly it is uploaded to the red board for it's use.

Last week has been a interesting week for me. I have learned quiet a bit from my peers and my teacher.
I have learned how to set up a bread board and a red board, how touse Arduino, and what exactly is a circuit. Yes the last week in specefic was very much interesting for me.

I would like my project to be something along the lines of "x" input produces "y" sound however the "x" input has to be super specefic like holding it in a special way to produce the "y" sound.
