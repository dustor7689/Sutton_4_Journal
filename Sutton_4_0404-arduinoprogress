So far my partner and I have completed the the sequence for the tetris theme and we are working on the frogger theme sequence. 

We need to complete more theme sequences and set up how they can be activated.

What we will be able to turn in Friday is currently unclear but I know for certain that we will atleast have 2 o more themes to present.

Some code changes that we are doing are the changing of the tempo, the songlength, delay, and frequency.

Our code hasn't changed to the point of completly new functions however our code has changed the already known/created functions to fit our need (as mentioned in the previous entry).
