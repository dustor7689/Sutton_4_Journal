I have learned that in CS the tinniest of details matter the just as much as the entirety of the code. As in something as small as a semicolon out of place or a missing comma can make or break a code. Everything matters within the code.

Within Arduino I have learned that the code corrisponds to the location of the parts of the breadbox and red board. Making sure that the parts are at the correct locations are key to success. 

I have learned that within CS the connections to other parts of the code can lead to the origin code's downfall should the connections be inefficient. A faulty piece of code in the right/worng area of a connected code can lead to both or more errors bugging out the code's job. This can easily be recified however sometimes the corrections take a significant amount of time.
