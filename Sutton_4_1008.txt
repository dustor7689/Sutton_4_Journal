My plan for my art project is to create a bunch of triangles or just wing it. Whatever catches my mind's eye the most.

I will probably try my hand at gc polygons and other methods similar to it.

I will incorporate a for loop by looping triangles.

I will create if, else if, and else statements aboutmy trianlges. 

I will try my best to not do as much mah as humanly possible.
