I am almost done with my art project. I am almost done because i simply must add a few strokes to the background and maybe a few extra to help resemble wood. 

When we were going over art methods i was considering making a bunch of triangles but then i decided not to because the idea went dry and negative in my mind after a bit of time passed so i went with making art of a wooden floor.

yes i noticed because my neighbors told me of it.

I have examined the sample code on github to better structure my own code in a similar way of the sample.

gc.fillRect(0, 12, 700, 688); <----- As seen in my code...
