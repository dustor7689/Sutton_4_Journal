The process of creativity is inception, incubation, illumination, realisation, and verification.

Inception means to understand the task, incubation push the task out of your main thoughts, illumination means to be inspired about the task, realisation is to give your inspiration flesh and muscle, and verification equates to confirming that the result accomplishes what must be done/it works.
